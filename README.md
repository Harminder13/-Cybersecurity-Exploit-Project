Stack Buffer Overflow Exploitation

This repository documents our collaborative effort to exploit a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in a program, manipulating its execution flow for malicious purposes.

Vulnerability Identification:
We found that the fgets library routine reads data from the network connection using an incorrect length parameter, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

Exploit Preparation and Execution:

    We designed shell code to execute the /bin/env command on the target server and send environment variables back to the attacker.
    Using assembly language, we crafted the shell code to be position-independent and free of null characters.
    We carefully managed null bytes and used NOP instructions for padding to align the return address properly.
    By overwriting the return address with the address of the shell code, we redirected the program's execution flow.
    The altered return address led to the execution of the shell code, achieving the data theft objective.

This project demonstrates our team's expertise in security analysis, assembly language programming, and exploit development, specifically targeting stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
